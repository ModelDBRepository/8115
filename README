This package is running with the NEURON simulation program written by Michael
Hines and available on internet at:
  http://www.neuron.yale.edu

The package contains mechanisms (.mod files) and programs (.oc files) needed 
to simulate synaptic background activity similar to in vivo measurements
using a model of fluctuating synaptic conductances.  This "point-conductance"
model recreates in-vivo-like membrane parameters, such as the depolarized
membrane potential, the low input resistance and high-amplitude membrane
potential fluctuations.  All details are given in the following paper:

Destexhe A, Rudolph M, Fellous JM and Sejnowski TJ. Fluctuating synaptic 
conductances recreate in-vivo-like activity in neocortical neurons.
Neuroscience 107: 13-24, 2001.

  PROGRAMS
  ========

demo_gfluct.oc : illustrates the point-conductance model


  MECHANISMS
  ==========

 Gfluct.mod		: fluctuating synaptic conductances
 INa_traub_shifted.mod  : fast sodium current
 IKd_traub.mod          : delayed-rectifier potassium current
 IM.mod 		: slow voltage-dependent potassium current (IM)


  HOW TO RUN
  ==========

To compile the demo, NEURON and INTERVIEWS must be installed and working on
the machine you are using.  Just type "nrnivmodl" to compile the mechanisms
given in the mod files.

Then, execute the main demo program by typing:

nrngui demo_gfluct.oc

(for older NEURON versions than 4.3.1
special demo_gfluct.oc -
)
Once the menu and graphics interface has appeared, click on "Init and Run" 
to start the simulation...
